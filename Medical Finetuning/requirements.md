# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a QLoRA-based fine-tuning workflow for medical language models using Unsloth's optimized framework in Google Colab. The system will enable efficient parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of large language models on medical datasets while maintaining memory efficiency through 4-bit quantization and low-rank adaptation techniques. The workflow will support domain-specific medical applications by adapting pre-trained models like Llama 3 or DeepSeek-R1 to clinical and medical question-answering tasks.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a machine learning researcher, I want to set up a QLoRA fine-tuning environment in Google Colab using Unsloth, so that I can efficiently fine-tune large language models on medical data with limited computational resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Colab notebook is executed THEN the system SHALL install and configure Unsloth with all required dependencies
2. WHEN Unsloth is initialized THEN the system SHALL verify GPU availability and memory allocation for 4-bit quantization
3. WHEN the environment setup is complete THEN the system SHALL display system specifications including GPU type, available memory, and Unsloth version

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to load and preprocess a medical dataset for fine-tuning, so that I can train the model on domain-specific clinical question-answer pairs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a medical dataset is specified THEN the system SHALL load the dataset in the required format for training
2. WHEN the dataset is loaded THEN the system SHALL validate that it contains proper question-answer pairs or instruction-response format
3. WHEN preprocessing begins THEN the system SHALL tokenize the data according to the chosen base model's tokenizer
4. WHEN tokenization is complete THEN the system SHALL format the data for instruction fine-tuning with proper prompt templates
5. IF the dataset exceeds memory limits THEN the system SHALL implement data streaming or chunking mechanisms

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to configure and load a base language model with QLoRA settings, so that I can perform memory-efficient fine-tuning on medical data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a base model is specified (Llama 3 or DeepSeek-R1) THEN the system SHALL load the model with 4-bit quantization enabled
2. WHEN the model is loaded THEN the system SHALL configure LoRA adapters with appropriate rank and alpha parameters for medical domain adaptation
3. WHEN QLoRA configuration is applied THEN the system SHALL verify that memory usage is within Colab's limits
4. WHEN the model setup is complete THEN the system SHALL display model architecture details and trainable parameter count

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to execute the fine-tuning process with proper monitoring, so that I can train the model effectively while tracking performance and resource usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN training begins THEN the system SHALL execute epoch-based training with configurable learning rate and batch size
2. WHEN each epoch completes THEN the system SHALL log training loss, learning rate, and memory usage statistics
3. WHEN training is in progress THEN the system SHALL display real-time progress indicators and estimated completion time
4. WHEN memory usage approaches limits THEN the system SHALL implement gradient checkpointing and other memory optimization techniques
5. IF training encounters errors THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery suggestions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to save and export the fine-tuned model adapters, so that I can preserve my trained model for future use and deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN training completes successfully THEN the system SHALL save the LoRA adapter weights to local storage
2. WHEN saving adapters THEN the system SHALL create a checkpoint with model configuration and training metadata
3. WHEN export is requested THEN the system SHALL provide options to download adapters to local machine or save to cloud storage
4. WHEN adapters are saved THEN the system SHALL verify the integrity of saved files and provide file size information

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to test the fine-tuned model on new medical queries, so that I can evaluate the model's performance on domain-specific tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing begins THEN the system SHALL load the fine-tuned adapters and merge them with the base model for inference
2. WHEN a medical query is provided THEN the system SHALL generate responses using the fine-tuned model
3. WHEN responses are generated THEN the system SHALL display both the query and the model's response with generation parameters
4. WHEN multiple test queries are processed THEN the system SHALL provide a comparison interface showing before/after fine-tuning performance
5. WHEN evaluation is complete THEN the system SHALL provide metrics on response quality and domain-specific accuracy

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to monitor and optimize memory usage throughout the workflow, so that I can maximize training efficiency within Colab's resource constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any major operation begins THEN the system SHALL display current GPU memory usage and availability
2. WHEN memory usage exceeds 80% of available capacity THEN the system SHALL implement automatic memory optimization strategies
3. WHEN training parameters are configured THEN the system SHALL validate that the configuration fits within available memory
4. WHEN memory optimization is applied THEN the system SHALL log the specific techniques used and memory savings achieved
5. IF memory errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide specific recommendations for reducing memory usage
